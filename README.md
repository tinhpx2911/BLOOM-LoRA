# BLOOM-LoRA
In this Project, we'll explore and apply state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques to large language models. The techniques we'll delve into are not only robust but also resource-efficient, allowing us to perform the task of fine-tuning even on the free T4 GPUs available in a Kaggle notebook.

Among the techniques we will explore is Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a novel method that has proven to be efficient and effective in adapting large pre-trained language models to specific tasks. LoRA is grounded in the hypothesis that updates to the weights during adaptation have a low "intrinsic rank", allowing us to constrain weight updates and reduce computational complexity, while preserving model performance.

Complementing LoRA, we will also engage with mixed-precision training. This technique combines different numerical precisions to perform computations, aiming to maximize the computational power of modern GPUs. Mixed-precision training can accelerate model training, reduce memory requirements, and thus enable us to train larger, more powerful models.

Finally, we will delve into distributed training, a must-know technique for handling very large models or datasets. With distributed training, we can leverage multiple GPUs or even multiple
